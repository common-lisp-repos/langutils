To clean up:
- Separate out utils for distribution
- Performance comparisons
  - vs. Brill C code and Allegro
  - vs. SBCL and CLISP

Easy enhancements:
- Anaphor resolution i/f in linear text
- Lexical bigram file support for tagger
- Direct support for wordlist for tagger

Potential new work:
- Alternative chunking
  Label objects, actions and events from lexicon & commonsense
- Commonsense constraint based parser
  - Could learn ala-brill
    Either a surprising verb pattern means an object can do x or y is the effect of x
    or we have a new syntactic rule or word role?
- Link grammar parser
